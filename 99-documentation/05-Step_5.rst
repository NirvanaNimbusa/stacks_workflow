Rename samples
**************

Rename and copy the samples
===========================

We provide a scripts to rename the extracted samples and move them into the
`04-all_samples` folder. The script behaves differently for samples that are
present only once in the `01-info_files/sample_information.csv` and for those
that are present more than once. If a sample is present only once, a link is
created, thus using no additional disk space. If it is present more than once,
all the copies are concatenated into one file, doubling the amount of disk
space taken by this sample (all the individual files PLUS the combined one).

.. code-block:: bash

 ./00-scripts/03_rename_samples.sh

Deleting samples with too few reads
===================================

If after splitting your samples you notice that some of have too few reads, you
can remove these from the `04-all_samples` folder and modify your
`01-info_files/sample_information.csv` file accordingly. The threshold for the
minimum number of reads will depend on your project, including on the number of
expected cut sites generated by your library preparation protocol.
