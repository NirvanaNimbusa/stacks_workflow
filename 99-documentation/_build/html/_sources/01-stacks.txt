Stacks workflow tutorial
************************

This goal of this workflow is to simplify the use of the STACKS program and to
create a folder architecture and code structure to help people tasked with
analysing GBS or RAD data and possessing, especially those with limited
UNIX/Linux experience, to jump on the analysis wagon faster. 

It was developed with the needs of our research group in mind as well as with
an emphasis on non-model species studies. We make no claim about its usefulness
to other groups or in other contexts, but we still believe it may be of use to
some.

This workflow has been tested with version 1.35 and earlier versions of STACKS
under Linux (Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04) and MacOSX (10.9 Mavericks and 10.10
Yosemite).

.. warning::

 Stacks_Workflow version 1.29 and up will not work with versions of STACKS
 older than 1.24 since tags of different lengths can now be split together and
 intermediary files are kept in compressed (.gz) format. We also recommend to
 avoid STACKS versions 1.22 to 1.28, which contained bugs that seem to have
 been fixed in version 1.29. Even better, use the latest STACKS version.

About STACKS
============
 
 The `STACKS analysis pipeline <http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/>`_ is
 among the most used tools for SNP discovery in Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS)
 and Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing (RAD) studies, with and without
 a reference genome. Here is diagram of the STACKS pipeline:

 Upon starting to use STACKS, it is highly suggested to read the two official
 STACKS papers:
 
 `Catchen, J. M., Amores, A., Hohenlohe, P. A., Cresko, W. A., Postlethwait, J.
 H., & De Koning, D. J. (2011). Stacks: Building and Genotyping Loci De Novo
 From Short-Read Sequences. G3, 1(3), 171–182. doi:10.1534/g3.111.000240
 <http://www.g3journal.org/content/1/3/171.full>`_
 
 `Catchen, J. M., Hohenlohe, P. A., Bassham, S., Amores, A., & Cresko, W. A.
 (2013). Stacks: an analysis tool set for population genomics. Molecular
 Ecology, 22(11), 3124–3140. doi:10.1111/mec.12354
 <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.12354/abstract>`_
 
 Also very useful paper to read before attempting to run Stacks:
 
 `Mastretta Yanes A, Arrigo N, Alvarez N et al. (2014) RAD sequencing,
 genotyping error estimation and de novo assembly optimization for population 
 genetic inference. Molecular Ecology Resources, n/a–n/a.

Overview of the steps
=====================

 #. Install stacks_workflow and STACKS with its dependencies
 #. Download your raw data files (Illumina lanes or Ion Proton chips)
 #. Clean the reads and assess their quality
 #. Extract individual data with process_radtags
 #. Rename the sample files
 #. Align reads to a reference genome (optional)
 #. STACKS pipeline
 #. Filtering the results
 #. Further analyses
