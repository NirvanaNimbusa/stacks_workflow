Rename samples
**************

Rename and copy the samples
===========================

We provide two scripts to rename the extracted samples and move them into the
`04-all_samples` folder. Use the appropriate one depending on whether some of
your samples have been sequenced more than once in all your sequencing data.

The simple case
---------------

The approach should be used if your samples have each been sequenced **ONLY
ONCE** in total. This means each sample is found a maximum of one time in all
of your sequenced lanes (Illumina) or chips (Ion Proton). This script will
create soft links from the extracted files found in `03-samples` folder and its
sub-folders to the `04-all_samples` folder.

.. code-block:: bash

 ./00-scripts/03_rename_samples_simple.sh

The more complex case
---------------------

The `simple case` approach uses no disk additional space but cannot be used if
some of your samples have been sequenced more then once, in which case the
different files for the same sample should be joined. This will double the
amount of space used by the `03-samples` folder. In this case, use the
following command:

.. code-block:: bash

 ./00-scripts/03_rename_samples_complex.sh

Deleting samples with too few reads
===================================

If after splitting your samples you notice that some of have too few reads, you
can remove these from the `04-all_samples` folder and modify your
`01-info_files/sample_information.csv` file accordingly. The threshold for the
minimum number of reads will depend on your project, including on the number of
expected cut sites generated by your library preparation protocol.
