Running into problems
=====================

#. Consider joining the `Stacks Google group

#. To help you solve computer related problems and start focusing back on
   biology, you should get this book: `Practical Computing for Biologists
   <http://practicalcomputing.org>`_ (go for paper, because the digital edition
   from Sinauer is useless). 
#. `Biostar <https://www.biostars.org>`_ is a useful bioinformatics forum.
#. `SEQanswers and SEQanswers wiki <http://seqanswers.com>`_ is another useful
   forum for all things related to Next Generation sequencing.
#. Of course, you can always ask `Google <https://www.google.com>`_ for help.
